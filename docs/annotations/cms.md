# CMS-specific Annotations
This chapter focuses on annotations that make changes to the CMS.

# @Featured
This annotation signifies that this field should be used when referencing a `@RestModel` or `@InnerObject`.

_Example_

If you want to refer to a Product's title instead of it's ID in the CMS, you would do.
```java
@RestModel(...)
class Product{
    private long id;
    
    @Featured
    private String title;
}
```

# @Hidden
This annotation signifies that a field or model should be hidden from the CMS.

_Example_
```java
@Hidden
private String keepOutOfCMS;
```

When placed on a `@RestModel`, it hides the model from the CMS.

_Example_
```java
@RestModel(...)
@Hidden
class HiddenModel{
    long id;
}
```
# @Importance
This annotation defines the order of a field in the CMS. The higher the importance, the higher it's listed in the CMS.

Negative valued @Importance fields(like `@Importance(-5)`) don't get displayed in the table view of your data.

_Example_
```java
@Importance(-1)
private int id;
```

# @View
This annotation completely swaps out the way models are presented in the CMS.
By default this is the `DefaultView`(located in the admin module).
An option is to use the `SingleView` instead. 
SingleView changes the default table of many items to a SingleView of only 1 item.
This allows to create things like a Settings panel.

Look at [this guide](guides/custom-views.md) on how I implemented the old Elepy docs site with @View

_Example_

```java
@View(SingleView.class)
@RestModel(...)
class SEOSettings{
    private String author;
    private String siteTitle;
    
    @Text(TextType.TEXTAREA)
    private String description;
    private String keywords
}
```
